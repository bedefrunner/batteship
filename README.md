#### Rules

This game is meant to be played on a shared screen. Players first choose the positions that they would like their battleships to be on the Ship grids. Once the second player has chosen ship positions, players have a few seconds to head up to the battle grids to fight.

The Battle Grid identifies a miss with gray, a hit with light green, and a sunken ship with dark green. You can not hit the same spot twice.

Once a player sinks all of the opponent's ships, the game is over!
